### Specifying Token Coverage 
Communicating coverage, service, and associated compliance in a consistent way across the network any particular YES. Utilizing a number of the standards available to date would provide the most seamless implementation between both old and new participants. It's important to understand that this is information from the validator. What that validator does is going to be based on their policies. 
The main two variables usually are going to be a company's corporate structures, and software solutions used. 
Even if the same regulatory compliance applies, different teams will have different ways in satisfying these obligations. 
A simple example could be if I were an exchange and our customers signed up with their phone number only. 
Publicly, it's only asking for a phone number, although internally that phone number may be running against a provider like Twilio in order to get a few more data points (e.g. First Name / Last Name).
