## EIP - DeFi YES Verification Token

We are proposing a standard for on-chain verification. DeFi (Decentralized Finance) carries the largest amount of use-cases, and barriers to entry for new participants into the market. Our focus was to design a solution that is as extensible as possible. Setting the ecosystem up for well beyond todays use-cases. 

Key requirements:
1. Practical - Does it solve a problem?
2. Compatible - Is it compatible with work that has already been done?
3. Extensibile - Satisfying the maximum amount of use-cases (present/future) for the industry.
4. Understandable - Simplifying the education & understanding for streamlining developer adoption.

We're really trying to ensure that we communicate what we're proposing as clearly as possible, that way we're getting the most meaningful feedback (positive or negative) and fostering a solid community discussion.

Our intentions here are to propose a solution to the regulatory barriers that are slowing down new developments and accessibility in financial services.
