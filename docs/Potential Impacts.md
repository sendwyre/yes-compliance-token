### Positively Impacts

#### Entrepreneurs
* Having access to more validated information at a lower cost.
* User-base out of the box from day one.

#### Regulatory oversight
* Ability to identify relevant licensed entities faster.

#### Technology
* Providing this digitized version of the regulatory status and practices will legitimize the technology for the current incumbents to adopt if chosen to do so.
* Increase velocity for applications to try/fail/iterate/try again.
* Moves toward a more self-custody focus for holding assets, which was the initial key value proposition.

#### Users
* Opt-in for participation if needed. Not compulsory (implementations will change depending on the provider, but best practice would say it’s a users choice).
* Privacy first approach means less duplication of sensitive information.
* Recycling sensitive data in a privacy first manner will lead to smoother UX. Smoother user experiences will unlock broader use-cases and interest.

#### Security
* Less sensitive information will result in platforms becoming less valuable for  potential targeted attacks.
* Lowering the technical expertise due to decreased attack surface area. **Not** deprioritizing security, but mitigating potential worst-case scenerios.


### Negatively Effected

#### Established licensed entities
* Teams who have built a moat around this knowledge gap, and leveraging that to reduce competition.
* Capital requirements will be reduced for newcomers and result in a more fair playing ground.

#### Verification Software
* Platforms who are currently servicing these markets will typically be able to earn from duplicate verifications of one user, from multiple providers (e.g. Two crypto exchanges needing to service a customer who’s already been verified on another platform.
